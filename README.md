> A programming language designed for Forms Over Data applications.

### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/basbossink/fod)

## Pipe dreams here only

The description below is for now a pipe dream only. The actual implementation
of this pipe dream is embryonic.

## Design goals

### Simplicity

Forms over data should be simple, so a language supporting this use case
should be easy to read, understand and write. A minimal feature set is
implied, think of languages like [Go](https://golang.org/),
[Scheme](http://www.scheme-reports.org/), [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) and
[SML](https://smlfamily.github.io/) but even simpler. 

#### No concurrency

To avoid a huge number of problems there are no concurrency primitives in the
language. Web requests are handled as if handlers are running on a single
thread irrespective of how the runtime interleaves them.

#### No `NULL`

It's just better this way 😀.

#### No exceptions

Errors are values similar to languages like Go, Rust and Zig.

#### No objects

Because functions are more fun 😉.

#### No mutability

All data types are immutable, holders of data.

### No impedence mismatches

#### T-SQL compatible type system

A type system that maps 1-to-1 to builtin [T-SQL data types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/data-types-transact-sql). 

#### Data access layer builtin

Given the matching type system data access code can be generated by the
compiler without help from the developer.

### Strong correctness guarantees

Through the use of type annotations, parametric polymorphism and contract
specifications that are part of the language the compiler can help you avoid
mistakes.

#### Validation emitted by the compiler

Given the rich type system both server and client side validation code can be
generated by the compiler.

### Performance

Compiles to native code for the server and WASM for the web.
